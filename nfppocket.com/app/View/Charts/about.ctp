<p>This is a Web App free of charge and created for users of the Creighton Model for Natural Family Planning. It is for charting your monthly cycle to keep track of your metrics. I originally created this for my wife and myself so that we could keep track of our charting and be able to collaborate online with our charting. We kept forgetting our chart before going to meet with our NFP consultant. This way we can't leave it behind.</p>
